Grade Calculator (Task 3) - Python Developer Internship
📌 Project Overview
This project is a part of my Python Developer Internship. The goal was to create a Grade Calculator that applies decision-making logic using Python's conditional statements. The program takes marks as input, validates them, and assigns a grade based on specific business rules.
🚀 Features
Data Validation: Checks if the input is a valid number between 0 and 100.
Dynamic Grading: Uses if-elif-else blocks to categorize marks.
Nested Logic: Includes special rewards (like "Distinction") for top-tier scores.
Logical Operators: Combines conditions using and and or for precise flow control.
Error Handling: Prevents the program from crashing if a user enters non-numeric text.
🛠️ Concepts Used
Conditionals: if, elif, else
Logical Operators: and, or
Type Casting: Converting user input using float() and int()
Error Handling: try-except blocks
Nesting: Evaluating secondary conditions within a primary condition.
📂 File Structure
grade_calculator.py: The main Python script.
README.md: Project documentation.
💻 How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed.
Clone this repository.
Run the following command in your terminal:
code
Bash
python grade_calculator.py
📝 Grading Logic
90 - 100: Grade A (95+ includes Distinction)
75 - 89: Grade B
60 - 74: Grade C
40 - 59: Grade D
Below 40: Fail
